### LinkedIn

**Professional Positioning:**
```
I built Clipso to solve a problem I had daily: finding that code snippet I copied hours ago.

Traditional clipboards use keyword search. If you copy "neural networks" and later search for "AI", you find nothing.

Clipso uses semantic AI (Apple's NLEmbedding) to understand meaning, not just keywords. And it runs 100% locally—no cloud, no privacy concerns.

The basic version is free forever. Premium is $7.99/year (vs Paste's $14.99).

Key differentiators:
• AI search at half the price of competitors
• 100% local processing (verifiable via open source)
• Freemium model: Try before you buy
• Generous free tier (10 AI searches/day)

If you copy code, write content, or manage multiple projects, this will change your workflow.

## Press Outreach Updates

### Email Template (Freemium Angle)

**Subject:** Privacy-first clipboard with AI—free, unlike $15/year competitors

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I built Clipso, a clipboard manager for macOS that's different in two key ways:

1. **Freemium vs forced subscription**: Paste and Copied force $10-15/year subscriptions. Clipso is free, with optional premium features at $7.99/year—47% cheaper.

2. **100% local AI vs cloud processing**: Unlike Paste, all AI processing happens on your Mac using Apple's NLEmbedding framework. Zero network requests. Open source for verification.

**Free features:**
- Semantic AI search (10/day limit)
- Unlimited clipboard history
- OCR text extraction
- Complete privacy

**Premium ($7.99/year):**
- Unlimited AI search
- Auto context detection
- iCloud sync (E2E encrypted)
- Custom snippets

This challenges the assumption that "AI features require expensive cloud subscriptions."

Would this interest your readers? Happy to provide:
- Review build (free + premium unlocked)
- Technical deep dive on local AI
- Comparison vs Paste/Copied

Best,
[Your Name]
```
