## Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Semantic Search Demo (THE MONEY SHOT)

**Setup:** Items 1-4 copied (AI/ML items)

**Action:**
1. Show traditional search box
2. Type: `AI`
3. Result: **0 matches** ❌ (because none say "AI" exactly)
4. Enable "Semantic Search" toggle
5. Type: `AI` again
6. Result: **4 matches** ✅ (neural networks, TensorFlow, deep learning, machine learning)

**Voiceover/Text:**
> "Traditional search: 0 results. Semantic search: finds everything related to AI."

**Why this works:** Dramatically shows the difference between keyword and semantic search

---

### Scenario 2: Context Detection Demo

**Setup:** All items 1-12 copied (mixed contexts)

**Action:**
1. Show unsorted clipboard list (all mixed together)
2. Click "Auto-detect contexts" button
3. Show automatic organization:
   - **AI/Machine Learning** (items 1-4)
   - **Personal** (items 5-7)
   - **Code/Development** (items 8-10)
   - **Work/Project** (items 11-13)

**Voiceover/Text:**
> "Automatically organizes your clipboard into projects. No folders. No tagging. It just works."

---

### Scenario 3: Another Semantic Search Example

**Setup:** Same items as Scenario 1

**Searches to demonstrate:**

| Search Query | Traditional | Semantic | Items Found |
|--------------|------------|----------|-------------|
| "AI" | 0 | 4 | All ML-related |
| "food" | 0 | 1 | Grocery list |
| "math" | 0 | 1 | Calculate distance |
| "appointment" | 1 | 1 | Dentist |

**Best for demo:** Pick 2-3 of these to show in succession

---

### Scenario 4: OCR Demo

**Preparation:**
1. Take a screenshot of text (use ⌘⇧4)
2. Screenshot this text:

```
INVOICE #12345
Acme Corporation
Total: $1,234.56
Due Date: January 31, 2025
```

**Action:**
1. Copy the screenshot image
2. Show Clipso automatically extracting text
3. Show extracted text: "INVOICE #12345..."
4. Click to copy just the text

**Voiceover/Text:**
> "Built-in OCR. Copy an image, get searchable text automatically."

## Tips for Recording

### Make It Visual

**Good:**
- Type slowly so viewers can read
- Pause 2 seconds on "0 results" to emphasize the problem
- Show mouse hovering over results
- Highlight text with cursor

**Bad:**
- Typing too fast
- Moving on before viewers can read
- Jerky mouse movements
- Not pausing on important moments

### Practice These Actions

Before recording, practice:
1. Opening app with ⌘⇧V (smooth, confident)
2. Typing search queries (slow enough to read)
3. Toggling semantic search (deliberate click)
4. Clicking through results (smooth scrolling)

### Common Mistakes

❌ **Too fast:** Slow down! Viewers need time to process

❌ **Mouse shaking:** Rest your wrist, use smooth movements

❌ **Not clearing search:** Clear search box between demos

❌ **Wrong order:** Follow script exactly for best narrative

✅ **Rehearse:** Do a practice run before recording

✅ **Multiple takes:** Record each scene 2-3 times, pick best

✅ **Check audio:** If adding voiceover, test microphone first
