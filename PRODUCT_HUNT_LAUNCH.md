### Full Description

```markdown
# Never Lose Important Clipboard Content Again

ClipboardManager is the first clipboard manager for Mac with **true AI intelligence** - and it's completely free and open source.

## 🧠 Semantic AI Search

Find clipboard items by **meaning**, not just keywords.

Search for "coffee recipes" and find:
- "espresso brewing guide"
- "how to make cappuccino"
- "latte art techniques"

Different words, same meaning. Powered by Apple's on-device NLEmbedding framework.

## 🎯 Automatic Context Detection

Your clipboard organizes itself into color-coded projects based on:
- Which apps you're using
- When you copied items
- How content relates to each other

No manual tagging. No folders. Just intelligence.

## 🔒 100% Private

Unlike competitors that send your data to the cloud, ClipboardManager does **all processing locally** using Apple's frameworks.

- Zero network requests
- Zero telemetry
- Zero compromise

Your clipboard data is as private as any other file on your Mac.

## ✨ Features That Set It Apart

**Built-in OCR** - Extract text from screenshots automatically
**Smart Categorization** - Auto-detects links, code, emails, colors
**AES-256 Encryption** - Bank-level security for sensitive items
**Global Hotkey** - Press ⌘⇧V anywhere to access history
**Smart Paste** - Context-aware formatting for different apps

## 💰 Free Forever vs The Competition

- **Paste**: $14.99/year
- **Copied**: $9.99/year
- **ClipboardManager**: $0 forever

## 🛠️ Built With

100% native Apple frameworks:
- Swift + SwiftUI
- NaturalLanguage (semantic search)
- Vision (OCR)
- Core Data (storage)
- CryptoKit (encryption)

No external dependencies. No cloud services.

## 🚀 Get Started

1. Download from GitHub
2. Drag to Applications
3. Press ⌘⇧V
4. Start copying!

Your clipboard just got a whole lot smarter.

## First Comment (Post Immediately)

This is crucial - pins your comment to the top.

```markdown
👋 Hey Product Hunt! I'm [Your Name], and I built ClipboardManager.

## The Problem

I copy hundreds of things daily - code snippets, links, notes. When I need to find something later, I'm stuck searching for exact keywords.

Traditional clipboard managers are just lists with Cmd+F. In 2025, we can do better.

## The Solution

ClipboardManager uses **semantic AI search** to understand meaning:

- Search "coffee recipes" → finds "espresso brewing guide"
- Search "AI" → finds "machine learning", "neural networks", "deep learning"
- All completely local using Apple's NLEmbedding framework

Plus **automatic context detection** that organizes your clipboard into color-coded projects based on app patterns, timing, and content similarity.

## Why Privacy Matters

Your clipboard contains sensitive stuff - API keys, passwords (accidentally), private messages. I wasn't about to send that to the cloud.

**100% of processing happens on your Mac.** Zero network requests. Zero telemetry. Verifiable in the source code.

## Why Free & Open Source?

Essential productivity tools should be accessible to everyone.

Other clipboard managers charge $10-15/year and require cloud sync. ClipboardManager is free forever and keeps everything local.

Open source because transparency builds trust - especially for privacy claims.

## Try It!

1. Download: [GitHub link]
2. Press ⌘⇧V
3. Start copying!

## Questions I'll Answer

💡 **How does semantic search work without cloud AI?**
🔒 **How can I verify it's truly private?**
⚡ **Does it slow down my Mac?**
🆚 **How does it compare to Paste/Copied/Maccy?**

Ask me anything! I'll be here all day responding to comments.

Thanks for checking it out! 🚀

## Comment Response Templates

### "How does semantic search work?"

```
Great question! It uses Apple's NLEmbedding framework to generate 50-dimensional semantic vectors for each clipboard item.

When you search, it compares the search query's embedding to stored items using cosine similarity. Similar concepts end up close together in the vector space, even if they use different words.

Example: "coffee" and "espresso" have similar vectors, but "coffee" and "bicycle" don't.

All happens locally in <50ms. No API calls needed!

More technical details in the README: [link to architecture section]
```

### "Is it really 100% private?"

```
Yes! You can verify this yourself since the code is open source.

Here's what to check:
1. Search the codebase for URLSession, Alamofire, network libraries → you won't find any
2. Run Little Snitch or a network monitor → zero connections
3. Review the ML code → all uses Apple's NLEmbedding (local)

The only "AI" is Apple's on-device frameworks. No OpenAI, no Anthropic, no cloud.

Your clipboard data is as private as any other file on your Mac.
```

### "Will this work with [other app]?"

```
Yes! ClipboardManager works system-wide with any Mac app.

It monitors NSPasteboard (the system clipboard), so it captures everything you copy from any application.

You can also exclude specific apps in Settings if needed (e.g., password managers).
```

### "Feature request: [X]"

```
Love this idea! I've added it to the roadmap.

Feel free to open an issue on GitHub with more details: [link]

Or if you want to implement it yourself, PRs are welcome! The codebase is pretty straightforward Swift/SwiftUI.
```

### "Found a bug with [X]"

```
Thanks for reporting! I can reproduce this.

I'll have a fix out in the next [24/48] hours. I'll update this comment when it's pushed.

In the meantime, workaround: [if applicable]

Really appreciate you testing and reporting!
```

### Negative comment or complaint

```
Thanks for the feedback! I appreciate you taking the time to test it.

[Address specific concern directly and honestly]

[If valid criticism] You're right, this is something I need to improve.

[If misunderstanding] Let me clarify: [explanation]

What would make this work better for your use case?
```

## Hunter/Maker Relationship

**Hunter**: The person who submits (can be you or someone else)

**Maker**: The creator (you)

**Best Scenario**: Get someone with followers to hunt it
- Increases visibility
- Their network sees it
- More initial upvotes

**If self-hunting**: Still works, just be very active in comments

---

## Getting Upvotes (Ethically)

### Do's:

✅ **Share on Twitter** - Tag @ProductHunt
✅ **Email supporters** - Ask for honest feedback
✅ **Post in relevant communities** - Hacker News, Reddit
✅ **Respond quickly** - Engagement drives visibility
✅ **Provide value** - Answer questions thoroughly

### Don'ts:

❌ **Buy upvotes** - Will get banned
❌ **Ask directly for upvotes** - Against rules
❌ **Use bots** - Obvious and banned
❌ **Mass DM people** - Spammy
❌ **Fake accounts** - Easy to detect

**Approved approach**: "Just launched on Product Hunt, would love your feedback!" (asking for feedback, not upvotes)
