- **Tag relevant accounts** - @ProductHunt, @9to5Mac, etc.

### Press Outreach

- **Tuesday-Thursday** - best days to reach journalists

- **Follow up once** - after 1 week, no more

### Product Hunt

- **Launch 12:01 AM PST** - get full 24 hours
- **First comment immediately** - pins it to top
- **Respond fast** - within 1-2 hours max
- **Provide value** - help people, don't just promote

## 📞 Support Resources

### If You Get Stuck

**Landing Page Issues:**
- See troubleshooting in `GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md`
- Test locally first: `python3 -m http.server 8000`

**Press Not Responding:**
- Normal! Most ignore cold emails
- Follow up once after 1 week
- Focus on communities (Reddit, HN) instead

**Product Hunt Going Poorly:**
- Engage heavily in comments - it's about feedback, not ranking
- Share on social - drive external traffic
- Be helpful - answer every question

**General Questions:**
- All guides have detailed instructions
- Check FAQ sections
- Open GitHub issue if truly stuck
