4. **Benefit-Focused**: "Find What You Copied by Meaning, Not Just Keywords"

## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

Clipso is an intelligent macOS clipboard manager that uses AI to understand what you copy. Unlike traditional clipboard managers that only match exact keywords, our semantic search finds items by *meaning*—search for "coffee recipes" and find "espresso brewing guide" or "latte art techniques." It automatically organizes your clipboard into projects, detects context, and keeps everything 100% private on your Mac. Generous free tier with optional Premium ($7.99/year)—47% cheaper than competitors with superior privacy. Open source and built for transparency.

## Key Messages

### 1. Intelligence That Actually Helps
Most clipboard managers are glorified lists. Clipso uses Apple's on-device ML to understand context and meaning, making it the first clipboard manager that actually thinks.

### 2. Privacy Without Compromise
Every other smart clipboard sends your data to the cloud. We do all AI processing on-device using Apple's frameworks. Zero network requests, zero telemetry, zero compromise.

### 3. Fair Freemium Pricing
Generous free tier with 10 AI searches/day. Premium is just $7.99/year—47% cheaper than Paste with superior privacy. We're open source and believe in transparent, affordable pricing.

**Feature Focus - Semantic Search**:
"Traditional clipboard: Search 'AI' → finds only 'AI'

Clipso: Search 'AI' → finds 'machine learning', 'neural networks', 'deep learning'

That's the power of semantic search.

**Feature Focus - Privacy**:
"Other clipboard managers: Your data → their servers → ???

Clipso: Your data → stays on your Mac → forever

100% local AI using Apple's frameworks. No exceptions."

**Feature Focus - Context Detection**:
"Your clipboard knows you're working on 3 different projects.

Why doesn't it organize itself?

Clipso detects app patterns, timing, and content similarity to auto-group your work.

Finally."

### LinkedIn (Professional Tone)

**Product Launch**:
"After months of development, I'm excited to share Clipso—a new approach to clipboard management for macOS.

Traditional clipboard managers are essentially lists with keyword search. We built something different: the first clipboard manager with semantic understanding.

Key innovations:
• Semantic search using Apple's NLEmbedding framework
• Context detection that automatically groups related items
• 100% on-device processing (no cloud dependency)
• Free and open source

For developers, this means finding that code snippet even when you can't remember the exact syntax. For researchers, it's automatic organization by project without manual tagging.

The best part? It's completely private. All AI runs locally using Apple's frameworks—zero network requests, zero telemetry.

Available now on GitHub. Would love your feedback.

### Reddit Posts

**r/MacApps**:
"[Open Source] Built a clipboard manager with semantic AI search - actually finds items by meaning"

"Hey r/MacApps,

I built Clipso because I was frustrated with losing code snippets and having to remember exact keywords to find things.

What makes it different:

1. **Semantic Search**: Uses Apple's NLEmbedding to understand meaning. Search "coffee recipes" and it finds "espresso brewing guide" - different words, same meaning.

2. **Context Detection**: Automatically groups clipboard items into projects based on app patterns, timing, and content similarity. No manual tagging.

3. **100% Private**: All AI processing happens on-device using Apple's frameworks. No cloud, no network requests.

4. **Free & Open Source**: No subscriptions, no limitations.

Technical details:
- Swift + SwiftUI
- Core Data for persistence
- NaturalLanguage framework for embeddings
- Vision framework for OCR
- AES-256-GCM encryption option

It's free on GitHub. Happy to answer questions or hear feedback.

**r/SideProject**:
"Built a clipboard manager with AI that actually understands context"

"**What I Built**: Clipso for macOS

**The Problem**: Traditional clipboard managers only do keyword matching. If you search for "artificial intelligence" but copied "machine learning", you won't find it.

**The Solution**: Semantic search using Apple's NLEmbedding framework. The AI understands that "AI", "machine learning", and "neural networks" are related concepts.

**Unique Features**:
- Hybrid search: 40% keyword + 30% semantic + 20% recency + 10% frequency
- Auto-detects projects by analyzing app usage patterns
- 100% local processing (privacy-focused)
- Built-in OCR for screenshots

**Tech Stack**: Swift, SwiftUI, Core Data, NaturalLanguage, Vision

**Status**: Free and open source on GitHub

**What I Learned**: On-device ML is way more powerful than I thought. Apple's NaturalLanguage framework can generate 50-dimensional embeddings in <100ms.

Would love feedback from other Mac users!"

## Press Release (Template)

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**New Open-Source Clipboard Manager Brings AI Intelligence to macOS**

*Clipso uses on-device machine learning to revolutionize clipboard search with semantic understanding and automatic project organization*

[CITY, DATE] — Today marks the release of Clipso, a free and open-source clipboard manager for macOS that introduces semantic search and context detection to clipboard management.

Unlike traditional clipboard managers that rely on exact keyword matching, Clipso uses Apple's on-device Natural Language framework to understand the meaning behind clipboard content. This allows users to find items even when they don't remember the exact words—searching for "coffee recipes" will surface "espresso brewing guide" or "how to make cappuccino."

**Key Features:**

- **Semantic Search**: Powered by Apple's NLEmbedding, with 50-dimensional sentence embeddings
- **Context Detection**: Automatically groups related clipboard items into projects based on app usage patterns, timing, and content similarity
- **Privacy-First**: 100% local processing with no cloud dependency or network requests
- **Built-in OCR**: Automatic text extraction from screenshots using Apple's Vision framework
- **Smart Categorization**: Auto-detects links, code, emails, colors, and more

"Most clipboard managers haven't evolved beyond being simple lists," said [Developer Name]. "We wanted to build something that actually understands what you're working on and helps you find what you need without manual organization."

Clipso is designed for developers, content creators, and knowledge workers who frequently switch between multiple projects and need quick access to previously copied content. The app runs as a lightweight menu bar utility and can be accessed globally via keyboard shortcut (⌘⇧V).

**Privacy and Open Source:**

In an era of increasing privacy concerns, Clipso processes all data locally using Apple's on-device ML frameworks. The application makes zero network requests and includes no telemetry. The codebase is fully open source, allowing security researchers to verify these claims.

**Availability:**

Clipso is available now as a free download from GitHub. It requires macOS 13.0 or later.

## Email Marketing Campaign

### Welcome Email (First Install)

**Subject**: Welcome to Clipso! Here's how to get started

**Body**:

Hi there! 👋

Thanks for installing Clipso. You're about to experience clipboard management that actually thinks.

**Quick Start Guide:**

1. **Access Your Clipboard**: Press ⌘⇧V anywhere in macOS
2. **Try Semantic Search**: Copy a few items about similar topics, then search for related concepts—you'll see the magic
3. **Let It Learn**: The context detector gets smarter as you use it

**Pro Tips:**

✨ **Search Modes**: Toggle between Keyword, Semantic, and Hybrid search to see the difference
🎯 **Project Tags**: Watch as your clipboard automatically organizes into color-coded projects
🔒 **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Right-click any item to enable encryption

**Your First Challenge:**

Try this: Copy these three items:
1. "Machine learning with Swift"
2. "Building neural networks"
3. "Deep learning tutorial"

Then search for "artificial intelligence"—even though those exact words weren't in any item, they'll all rank highly. That's semantic search in action.

Questions? Reply to this email or check out the [documentation].

Happy clipping!
